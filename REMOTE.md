# Remote Access

## Official iOS compatibility target

The direct-pairing compatibility target is the App Store release **T3 Code
1.0.1** (`com.t3tools.t3code`, released 2026-07-31) and its upstream mobile
contract as inspected at `pingdotgg/t3code@d7950ac153c6fdd788ef63699a5d061243bb4997`.

The server supports both authentication generations:

| Client flow                     | Pairing exchange                  | Persistent credential | WebSocket ticket                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Official iOS / current upstream | `POST /oauth/token`               | scoped `access_token` | `POST /api/auth/websocket-ticket`, then `wsTicket` |
| Legacy fork clients             | `POST /api/auth/bootstrap/bearer` | `sessionToken`        | `POST /api/auth/ws-token`, then `wsToken`          |

OAuth sessions persist their granted scopes and enforce them for HTTP and RPC
operations. Legacy sessions retain their role-derived scopes so existing paired
clients continue to work.

The official `orchestration.searchThreads` RPC and direct workspace payloads
for `projects.searchEntries` and `projects.readFile` are supported alongside
the fork's existing transcript-search and thread/project-scoped payloads.

The official app's background activity protocol is also supported. Mobile
clients report a 45-second activity lease every 25 seconds through
`server.reportClientActivity`; reconnects replace the previous lease for the
same authenticated session and stable device ID. Background-policy reads are
session-filtered, and only the local owner session may report host power state.

Use this when you want to connect to a T3 Code server from another device such as a phone, tablet, or separate desktop app.

## Recommended Setup

Use a trusted private network that meshes your devices together, such as a tailnet.

That gives you:

- a stable address to connect to
- transport security at the network layer
- less exposure than opening the server to the public internet

## Enabling Network Access

There are two ways to expose your server for remote connections: from the desktop app or from the CLI.

### Option 1: Desktop App

If you are already running the desktop app and want to make it reachable from other devices:

1. Open **Settings** → **Connections**.
2. Under **Manage Local Backend**, toggle **Network access** on. This will restart the app and run the backend on all network interfaces.
3. The settings panel will show the address the server is reachable at (e.g. `http://192.168.x.y:3773`).
4. Use **Create Link** to generate a pairing link you can share with another device.

### Option 2: Headless Server (CLI)

Use this when you want to run the server without a GUI, for example on a remote machine over SSH.

Run the server with `t3 serve`.

```bash
npx t3 serve --host "$(tailscale ip -4)"
```

`t3 serve` starts the server without opening a browser and prints:

- a connection string
- a pairing token
- a pairing URL
- a QR code for the pairing URL

From there, connect from another device in either of these ways:

- scan the QR code on your phone
- in the desktop app, enter the full pairing URL
- in the desktop app, enter the host and token separately

Use `t3 serve --help` for the full flag reference. It supports the same general startup options as the normal server command, including an optional `cwd` argument.

### Pair an already-running server

`t3 pair` discovers a live foreground server or the per-base-directory background service, verifies its PID and public environment descriptor, and mints a one-time client credential without restarting it.

```bash
npx t3 pair
npx t3 pair --base-dir ~/.t3 --ttl 10m --label "Ronak iPhone"
npx t3 pair --base-dir ~/.t3 --tailscale
npx t3 pair --base-dir ~/.t3 --tailscale --tailscale-serve-port 8443
```

The command prints the canonical `/pair#token=...` URL, token, expiry, and QR code. `--tailscale` safely reuses a matching Tailscale Serve mapping, refuses to replace another T3 environment or non-T3 service, and prints the exact per-port teardown command when it creates a persistent HTTPS mapping.

> Note
> The GUIs do not currently support adding projects on remote environments.
> For now, use `t3 project ...` on the server machine instead.
> Full GUI support for remote project management is coming soon.

## How Pairing Works

The remote device does not need a long-lived secret up front.

Instead:

1. `t3 serve` issues an initial owner pairing token, while `t3 pair` issues a standard client pairing token for an existing server.
2. The remote device exchanges that token with the server.
3. The server creates an authenticated session for that device.

After pairing, future access is session-based. You do not need to keep reusing the original token unless you are pairing a new device.

## Managing Access Later

Use `t3 auth` to manage access after the initial pairing flow.

Typical uses:

- issue additional pairing credentials
- inspect active sessions
- revoke old pairing links or sessions

Use `t3 auth --help` and the nested subcommand help pages for the full reference.

## Security Notes

- Treat pairing URLs and pairing tokens like passwords.
- Prefer binding `--host` to a trusted private address, such as a Tailnet IP, instead of exposing the server broadly.
- Anyone with a valid pairing credential can create a session until that credential expires or is revoked.
- Use `t3 auth` to revoke credentials or sessions you no longer trust.

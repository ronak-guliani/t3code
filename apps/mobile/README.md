# T3 Code Mobile

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code Mobile is currently in development and is not distributed yet. If you want to try it out, you can build it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `T3 Code`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

## Development

Start Metro for the dev client:

```bash
vp run dev:client
```

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
vp run ios:dev
```

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
vp run ios:preview
```

Force the review diff highlighter engine:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=javascript vp run ios:dev
```

`javascript` is the default and recommended setting for the review diff screen. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=native` only when you explicitly want to test the native Shiki engine.

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
vp run config:dev
vp run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## Direct Connect acceptance

The no-Clerk direct path requires a reachable HTTPS origin. Hosted browsers will block an
`http://` API or `ws://` socket as mixed content, so use the Tailscale HTTPS URL for both browser
and mobile pairing; the clients derive `wss://` from that origin.

1. Install Tailscale on the workstation and test device, sign both into the same tailnet, and
   enable HTTPS certificates for the tailnet.
2. From the repository root, build and start the fork server on the tailnet:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter t3 build
   tailscale serve --bg --https=443 127.0.0.1:3773
   pnpm start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3773 --no-browser
   ```

3. In another terminal, create a one-time client pairing URL:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter t3 start -- auth pairing create \
     --base-url https://<workstation>.<tailnet>.ts.net
   ```

4. Open that HTTPS URL in the matching fork browser build, or in **T3 Code Dev** choose
   **Add environment** and scan/paste the URL. Pairing persists a bearer session; Clerk and the
   managed relay are not involved.
5. Open a thread, send a message, then disable and re-enable Wi-Fi (or background/foreground the
   app). Verify the connection returns to connected, the thread resnapshots without duplicate
   messages, and a queued mobile message drains once.

Automated protocol coverage is available from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm test:direct-connect-smoke
```

It starts the real server routes and verifies one-time browser and shared mobile-runtime pairing,
authenticated HTTP shell bootstrap, authenticated WebSocket snapshots, a production orchestration
mutation persisted to SQLite, fresh-ticket reconnect through the shared `WsTransport`, and
duplicate-free resnapshot. Browser-mode coverage also exercises the production `/pair` surface,
credential exchange, cookie-enabled request, and removal of the one-time token from browser history.
It does not replace the physical-device network check above.

After acceptance, stop the server with `Ctrl-C`, remove the persistent Serve mapping, and revoke the
acceptance session so its bearer credential cannot be reused:

```bash
tailscale serve status
tailscale serve off --https=443
pnpm --filter t3 start -- auth session list
pnpm --filter t3 start -- auth session revoke <session-id>
pnpm --filter t3 start -- auth pairing list
```

Revoke any still-active pairing credential shown by the final command with
`pnpm --filter t3 start -- auth pairing revoke <pairing-id>`. Do not store the printed pairing URL
or bearer token in shell history, screenshots, logs, or source control.

## EAS Builds

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
vp run eas:android:dev
vp run eas:android:preview
```

/**
 * Three durability additions for the queued-message queue:
 *
 * 1. `projection_queued_turns.queue_position` — explicit per-thread delivery
 *    order, so a user reorder survives a restart instead of being rebuilt from
 *    creation timestamps. Existing rows are backfilled from their current
 *    `created_at` order, which is exactly the order they already delivered in.
 * 2. `projection_threads.queue_held_at` — a thread-level hold. When non-null
 *    the queue will not drain until the user releases it, so a queued prompt
 *    never fires unprompted after crash recovery.
 * 3. `server_shutdown_marker` — a single row recording whether the previous
 *    server process shut down cleanly. Boot reads and clears it; the graceful
 *    shutdown finalizer sets it. An unset row means the last process died,
 *    which is what distinguishes crash recovery from a planned restart.
 *
 * All statements are idempotent because a divergent migration ledger can skip
 * an earlier migration and replay this one against a database that already has
 * some of the shape (see scars: preserve released migration ordering).

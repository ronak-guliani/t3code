/**
 * Hand parsed PR review findings to the canonical monitor pipeline so they become durable,

 * existing monitor owner; only linkedReviewThreadId moves to the review chat.
 *
 * Consumption is at-least-once. At startup the hot live stream is attached and buffered
 * before the backlog is read (snapshot-first), so no event can fall between the two
 * sources; buffered events are only processed after the backlog replays successfully.
 * Handling is therefore strictly ascending, which
 * lets one watermark enforce the restart guarantee: after any event exhausts its retries,
 * cursor persistence freezes for the rest of the session, keeping the persisted cursor
 * behind that event. Later events still proceed without stalling (their submissions are
 * not lost), and a restart replays from behind the gap to re-attempt it; resubmitted
 * events are idempotent by content key. Settings gate the behaviour, and failures never
 * block the review itself.

# Project scars index

Keep this file small and load the detailed scar only for the subsystem being changed.

## Universal invariants

- Preserve credentials, tokens, private prompts, and user data; redact them from logs, screenshots, exports, and reports.
- Keep destructive, external, merge, approval, and credentialed operations behind explicit authorization and recoverable boundaries.
- Preserve isolated state, workspace ownership, provider lifecycle, and ambiguous-outcome recovery.
- Validate the acceptance criteria and relevant behavior, report blockers plainly, and do not treat an unrelated passing command as proof.

## Subsystem index

The complete scar record is preserved in `.agents/references/scars/full.md`. Load the linked sections relevant to the changed behavior, including related subsystems for cross-cutting changes. Each heading bounds a section; there is no requirement to read the whole archive.

When a new hard-earned lesson is discovered, add it to `full.md` under the matching area and keep this index updated. Do not replace a detailed scar with a generic reminder.
